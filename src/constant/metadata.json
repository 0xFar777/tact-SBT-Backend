    "description": "Soul-bound tokens are non-transferable; once you acquire a soul-bound token, it will be forever bound to your personal wallet and identity, unable to be sold or gifted to others. Therefore, for assets such as certificates of ability, reputation, medical records, etc., which cannot be obtained through purchase, soul-bound tokens are an ideal digital representation",
